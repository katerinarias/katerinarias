**Project Overview**: 
This project develops an advanced mutation testing framework that intelligently generates and selects mutations to evaluate test suite effectiveness. We're creating novel mutation operators and selection strategies to make mutation testing more efficient and practical.

**Key Objectives**:
- Design context-aware mutation operators
- Develop intelligent mutation selection algorithms
- Create performance optimization techniques
- Build IDE integration for real-time feedback

**Current Progress**:
- Implemented core mutation engine
- Developed initial set of smart operators
- Created preliminary selection algorithm
- Testing on large-scale projects
