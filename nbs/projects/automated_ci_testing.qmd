**Project Overview**: 
This project investigates novel approaches to improve automated testing in CI pipelines. We focus on developing intelligent test selection and prioritization strategies that can reduce build times while maintaining test effectiveness.

**Key Objectives**:
- Develop machine learning models for test selection
- Create adaptive test prioritization algorithms
- Reduce CI pipeline execution time
- Maintain or improve test coverage and effectiveness

**Current Progress**:
- Completed initial data collection from open-source projects
- Implemented prototype test selection algorithm
- Evaluating performance on real-world CI pipelines
- Preparing experimental framework for comparative analysis
