**Project Overview**: 
This project explores the integration of machine learning techniques with static analysis tools to improve bug detection accuracy and reduce false positives. We're developing novel approaches that combine traditional static analysis with learned patterns from codebases.

**Key Objectives**:
- Develop ML models to learn from historical bug patterns
- Enhance static analyzers with ML-based pattern recognition
- Reduce false positive rates in static analysis
- Create hybrid analysis techniques combining static and ML approaches

**Current Progress**:
- Built dataset of verified bug reports and fixes
- Implemented initial ML model for pattern recognition
- Integrated with existing static analysis tools
- Conducting preliminary accuracy evaluations
