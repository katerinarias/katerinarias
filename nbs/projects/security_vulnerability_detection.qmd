**Project Overview**: 
This project develops automated techniques for detecting security vulnerabilities in software systems. We combine static analysis, dynamic testing, and machine learning to identify potential security issues early in the development process.

**Key Objectives**:
- Develop hybrid analysis techniques for vulnerability detection
- Create pattern recognition models for security anti-patterns
- Build automated security testing frameworks
- Generate detailed vulnerability reports with remediation steps

**Current Progress**:
- Implemented initial vulnerability detection engine
- Created database of common security patterns
- Developed automated test generation for security scenarios
- Testing integration with development workflows
