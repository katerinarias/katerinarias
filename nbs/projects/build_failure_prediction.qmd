**Project Overview**: 
This project develops predictive models to identify potential build failures before they occur. By analyzing historical build data, code changes, and system configurations, we aim to provide early warnings and suggestions to prevent build breakages.

**Key Objectives**:
- Create predictive models for build failure detection
- Identify key indicators of build instability
- Develop real-time monitoring and alert systems
- Generate actionable recommendations for developers

**Current Progress**:
- Collected extensive build history data
- Developed initial prediction models
- Created prototype monitoring system
- Testing integration with CI/CD pipelines
