**About me**:

My PhD research focused on improving software security and testing practices, with particular emphasis on automated vulnerability detection and addressing flaky tests. I developed novel approaches for analyzing test suite evolution and identifying security vulnerabilities in software systems. Currently, as a Security Researcher at CyberSec Institute, I continue to advance the field of software security through research and development of automated vulnerability detection techniques.
