**About me**:

My PhD research focused on improving build systems and dependency management in large-scale software projects. I developed innovative approaches to optimize build processes and manage complex dependency networks in evolving software systems. Now, as a Senior Software Engineer at DevOps Solutions, I apply my research expertise to solve real-world challenges in software development and deployment pipelines.
