**About me**:

I am a PhD candidate studying the evolution of software systems and how to optimize development workflows. My research combines static analysis techniques with CI/CD pipeline optimization to better understand and improve how software systems evolve over time. I am particularly interested in developing tools and methodologies that can help teams maintain and evolve their software more efficiently while preserving code quality.
