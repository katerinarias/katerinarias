**About me**:

I am an MSc student focusing on improving software development processes through data-driven insights. My research explores how to enhance code review practices and measure developer productivity effectively. I am particularly interested in understanding how knowledge flows through development teams and creating tools that can help capture and share this knowledge more efficiently.
