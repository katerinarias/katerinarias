**About me**:

I am a PhD candidate specializing in continuous integration and software testing. My research focuses on developing predictive models for build failures, improving mutation testing techniques, and enhancing automated testing in CI pipelines. I am passionate about helping development teams identify and prevent integration issues early in the development process, ultimately improving software quality and team productivity.
