We're excited to announce the release of BuildGuard, an open-source tool that leverages machine learning to predict and prevent build failures before they occur. The tool integrates with popular CI platforms and has shown to reduce build failures by up to 40% in our initial deployments. Check out the tool on our GitHub repository.
