**Project Overview**: This project develops automated techniques for
detecting security vulnerabilities in software systems. We combine
static analysis, dynamic testing, and machine learning to identify
potential security issues early in the development process.

**Key Objectives**: - Develop hybrid analysis techniques for
vulnerability detection - Create pattern recognition models for security
anti-patterns - Build automated security testing frameworks - Generate
detailed vulnerability reports with remediation steps

**Current Progress**: - Implemented initial vulnerability detection
engine - Created database of common security patterns - Developed
automated test generation for security scenarios - Testing integration
with development workflows
