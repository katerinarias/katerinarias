**Project Overview**: This project develops an advanced mutation testing
framework that intelligently generates and selects mutations to evaluate
test suite effectiveness. Weâ€™re creating novel mutation operators and
selection strategies to make mutation testing more efficient and
practical.

**Key Objectives**: - Design context-aware mutation operators - Develop
intelligent mutation selection algorithms - Create performance
optimization techniques - Build IDE integration for real-time feedback

**Current Progress**: - Implemented core mutation engine - Developed
initial set of smart operators - Created preliminary selection
algorithm - Testing on large-scale projects
