**Project Overview**: This project develops predictive models to
identify potential build failures before they occur. By analyzing
historical build data, code changes, and system configurations, we aim
to provide early warnings and suggestions to prevent build breakages.

**Key Objectives**: - Create predictive models for build failure
detection - Identify key indicators of build instability - Develop
real-time monitoring and alert systems - Generate actionable
recommendations for developers

**Current Progress**: - Collected extensive build history data -
Developed initial prediction models - Created prototype monitoring
system - Testing integration with CI/CD pipelines
