Identified key factors in successful code reviews - Developed automated
review assignment system - Published findings in top software
engineering venues

**Impact**: - Platform adopted by multiple open-source projects -
Reduced review response times by 40% - Improved code quality metrics by
25% - Generated insights for improving review processes
