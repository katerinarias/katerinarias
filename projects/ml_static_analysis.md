**Project Overview**: This project explores the integration of machine
learning techniques with static analysis tools to improve bug detection
accuracy and reduce false positives. Weâ€™re developing novel approaches
that combine traditional static analysis with learned patterns from
codebases.

**Key Objectives**: - Develop ML models to learn from historical bug
patterns - Enhance static analyzers with ML-based pattern recognition -
Reduce false positive rates in static analysis - Create hybrid analysis
techniques combining static and ML approaches

**Current Progress**: - Built dataset of verified bug reports and
fixes - Implemented initial ML model for pattern recognition -
Integrated with existing static analysis tools - Conducting preliminary
accuracy evaluations
