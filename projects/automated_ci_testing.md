**Project Overview**: This project investigates novel approaches to
improve automated testing in CI pipelines. We focus on developing
intelligent test selection and prioritization strategies that can reduce
build times while maintaining test effectiveness.

**Key Objectives**: - Develop machine learning models for test
selection - Create adaptive test prioritization algorithms - Reduce CI
pipeline execution time - Maintain or improve test coverage and
effectiveness

**Current Progress**: - Completed initial data collection from
open-source projects - Implemented prototype test selection algorithm -
Evaluating performance on real-world CI pipelines - Preparing
experimental framework for comparative analysis
