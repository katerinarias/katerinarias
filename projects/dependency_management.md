**Project Overview**: This project developed an intelligent system for
managing software dependencies, focusing on security, compatibility, and
performance implications. We created tools to analyze dependency graphs
and recommend optimal update strategies.

**Key Achievements**: - Built automated dependency analysis engine -
Developed compatibility prediction models - Created intelligent update
scheduling system - Implemented security vulnerability tracking

**Impact**: - Reduced dependency-related bugs by 60% - Automated 80% of
dependency updates - Decreased security vulnerabilities by 45% - Tools
integrated into major package managers
