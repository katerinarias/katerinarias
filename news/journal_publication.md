Our research on “Automated Detection of Resource Waste in Continuous
Integration Environments” has been accepted for publication in IEEE
Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE). This work presents novel
techniques for identifying and eliminating computational resource waste
in CI/CD pipelines, potentially leading to significant cost savings for
software organizations.
