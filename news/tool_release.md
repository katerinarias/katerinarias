# Release of BuildGuard: AI-Powered Build Failure Prevention Tool

2023-11-20

Weâ€™re excited to announce the release of BuildGuard, an open-source tool
that leverages machine learning to predict and prevent build failures
before they occur. The tool integrates with popular CI platforms and has
shown to reduce build failures by up to 40% in our initial deployments.
Check out the tool on our GitHub repository.
